# Chapter 4.4 Deliver

# 4.4.01 
We have the following Mini Proposition in the Mad Lib format: We have observed
that managing sleep patterns is challenging for shift workers who struggle with
maintaining a healthy and consistent sleep schedule due to their varying work hours.
ChronoGuruX is a mobile app that provides personalized recommendations for sleep,
diet, and exercise based on advanced algorithms and DNA analysis to optimize their
sleep and performance. Unlike traditional sleep tracking apps, our product focuses
specifically on the unique needs of shift workers, offering tailored features such as light
therapy, soundscapes, and meditation to enhance their overall sleep experience.
Create 5 questions tailored for user testing. The goal is to get insightful feedback from
a user about a mini proposition. Use open ended questions. For each question, specify
why that question is useful.

# 4.4.02
Come up with 3 shift worker personas. Make them very different from each other in
terms of age, background, gender, and profession. For each of these personas, first
have them look at the ChronoGuruX mini proposition, and then answer the 5 questions
above. Format your output as a table. Include name, age, gender, profession, and the
answers to each question. For each persona, use a single row.

# 4.4.03
Come up with 2 revenue streams for ChronoGuruX. For each, come up with a price
point, a percentage of users that will purchase, and number of purchases per year.

# 4.4.04
Estimate the development and operational costs for ChronoGuruX. Give initial costs,
recurring costs, and marketing costs.

# 4.4.05
Using the results for costs and revenue streams, create a business case for
ChronoGuruX for 3 years. Assume we capture 0.01% of the market at first, so 70,000
users, and eventually we capture 0.1%, so 700,000 users. Give your result as a table,
vertically list user base, revenue and costs, horizontally year 1, year 2, year 3

them.

ChronoGuruX is the ultimate app for shift workers who struggle with their sleep
patterns. Using advanced algorithms and DNA analysis, the app identifies the user's
ChronoType and provides personalized recommendations for sleep, diet, and exercise.
With features like light therapy, soundscapes, and meditation, ChronoGuruX helps
shift workers optimize their sleep and performance. The app uses a combination of
user input and DNA analysis to determine the user's ChronoType, which refers to their
individual internal clock and sleep-wake cycle.
Once the ChronoType is identified, the app offers personalized sleep
recommendations, such as ideal sleep times, duration, and nap schedules. The app
also provides customized recommendations for diet and exercise, based on the user's
ChronoType and their daily routine.
ChronoGuruX offers various features to help improve sleep quality, such as light
therapy, which uses exposure to natural light to help regulate the user's internal clock.
The app also includes a variety of soundscapes designed to promote relaxation
and restful sleep, along with guided meditations and breathing exercises. The app
also includes AI-powered chatbots that provide instant feedback and suggestions.
ChronoGuruX is designed with a sleek and modern interface, featuring cuttingedge
