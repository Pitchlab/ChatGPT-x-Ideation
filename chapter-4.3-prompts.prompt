# Chapter 4.3 Develop

# 4.3.01
In the Customer Journey, we identified three key 'low points'. Can you come up with
5 How Might We questions to address the bad situation? The low points are:
1. Morning Wake-up: Waking up after a night or day of sleep, feeling refreshed or still
tired. The job to be done is to provide tools or techniques to wake up more easily and
feel more refreshed.
2. Sleep Time: Trying to fall asleep and stay asleep. The job to be done is to provide
solutions that improve sleep quality and duration
3. Transitioning Shifts: Switching between different work shift patterns, adapting to
new sleep and work schedules. The Job to be done is to provide strategies and tools
for smoother shift transitions.
An example of a How Might We question is: How Might We help Sarah, Emily and Olivia
reduce stress caused by difficulty waking up at morning wake up?

# 4.3.02
How might we develop innovative digital products and services to help Sarah, Emily
and Olivia manage their shift work sleep disorder and continue to feel relief and
improvement in her symptoms?

# 4.3.03
Create 5 innovative product ideas that alleviate shift work sleep disorder. Each solution
is a smartphone app, since a mobile phone is always available. Each solution should
focus on either predicting, prevention, monitoring, helping with sleep, or alleviating
symptoms. Make the solutions as different from each other as possible. Describe how
each solution helps combat shift work sleep disorder and how it helps against mood
and other problems resulting from shift work sleep disorder.

# 4.3.13
Take each of the following ideas to the next level. Make them really extreme, different
from each other and futuristic. Rewrite them so they are not hypothetical but real.
Avoid 'could'.
Non-Tech Solution: ChronoGuruX could be a specialized sleep program that users
attend in person. This program could include workshops on sleep hygiene, guided
meditation sessions, and personalized consultations with sleep experts. The program
could also offer customized sleep tracking and recommendations based on individual
ChronoTypes.
Non-Invasive Biometric Device: ChronoGuruX could be paired with a wearable device
that measures biometrics like heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate. The device
could use advanced machine learning algorithms to provide personalized sleep
recommendations based on the user's ChronoType and biometric data. This data
could also be used to generate reports for healthcare providers.
Brainwave Headband: ChronoGuruX could be paired with a brainwave headband
that tracks the user's brain activity during sleep. This data could be used to provide
personalized sleep recommendations based on the user's ChronoType and brain
activity patterns. The app could also provide guided meditation and other features to
help users optimize their sleep.
Audio-Only Solution: ChronoGuruX could be an audio-only app that provides
personalized sleep recommendations and features like guided meditation, white
noise, and soundscapes. The app could use machine learning algorithms to analyze
the user's voice and provide recommendations based on their ChronoType and other
biometric data.
ChronoType Focus: ChronoGuruX could be a specialized app that focuses exclusively
on the user's ChronoType. The app could provide detailed reports on the user's
ChronoType, including personalized sleep recommendations and other insights.
The app could also include features like guided meditation, light therapy, and
soundscapes to help users optimize their sleep.(...)
